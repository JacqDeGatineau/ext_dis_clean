My external hard drive for my computer's backup was full, so I created a script to 
check between my two external hard drives for duplicate files. 
It checks the drives or directories for duplicates and print the duplictaes to a file.

After the search the program asks whether the user wants to remove the files.
If the user selects Y, the prgram remves the duplicates files and directories, if they are empty.
